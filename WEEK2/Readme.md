This task focuses on learning the processes and methodologies used for Penetration Testing.

Step by step breakdown of the task:

1.Learning the theoretical concepts: 
  Includes understanding the concepts like Vulnerability Scanning Techniques, Penetration Testing Techniques and Exploit Development Basics.
  It involves familiarizing with core and important tools like Nmap, Nikto, Metasploit, Vulnerability Scoring using CVSS Calculator, OWASP Testing Guide for web scanning,
  Case-studying WannaCry case for CVSS mapping, Understanding the PTES, Studying ExploitDB for PoCs

2.Practical Training:
  Using Nmap, OpenVAS, Nikto for vulnerability scanning, running scans, prioritizing vulnerabilities, using tools like Maltego,Censys,Shodan, WHOis records for reconnaissance;
  Using Metasploit, Burp Suite, sqlmap to exploit Metasploitable machine; Escalate privileges, collect evidences using Meterpreter, sha256sum;
  Writing a 200-word PTES report and Draft a 100-word non-technical summary.
